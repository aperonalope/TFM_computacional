This repository contains all the scripts and files that were used for the masters thesis titled "vscRNAFinder: A biochemical-bioinformatic pipeline to detect small circular RNAs"

VscRNAFinder is a bioquemical-bioinformatic pipeline aimed at detecting very small circle RNAs by detecting the repetitive units of rolling circle tandem repeats and aligning them to the genome.
It is a nextflow pipeline that uses a singularity container

The scipts folder contain all the scripts used either for creating the graphs present on the masters thesis manuscript or the ones employed by nextflow
